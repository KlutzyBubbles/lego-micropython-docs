# lego-micropython-docs

GitHub Pages host for the Official Lego MicroPython Documentation found locally through the Visual Studio Code Extension.

This Repository is in no way affiliated with Lego, we only have the Docs here for easier use instead of the PDF.

You can find the docs hosted at: https://klutzybubbles.github.io/lego-micropython-docs/
